# SnakeLadderGame
As we all have played this game once in our lifes.
I coded this game as a project after learning C language .The game is completely developed using C language 
Description:
We have a fixed boundary within which we get food for our snake and we need to eat it and with that our score increases
and the length of snake as well .We need to protect our snake from hitting the boundary and also from crossing its tail as 
well.
Like this scores are calculated .
Try it yourself and relive oe of the best childhood memory.
